# Toronto Beach Observations Analysis

## Overview

This repository provides the structure and resources for analyzing the Toronto Beach Observations dataset. The project involves simulating, cleaning, and analyzing data to explore the factors influencing waterfowl counts at various beaches in Toronto. The repository is designed to facilitate reproducible research and is aligned with the principles of *Telling Stories with Data*.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/00-simulated_data` contains the simulated dataset used for testing and model validation.
-   `data/01-raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from Open Data Toronto.
-   `data/02-analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset, processed for analysis.
-   `models` stores the fitted statistical models used in the analysis. 
-   `other` contains supplementary materials, such as documentation of LLM interactions, datasheet and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean and analyze data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of ChatGPT. Some parts of paper were written with the help of ChatGPT and the entire chat history is available in `other/llm_usage/usage.txt`.
